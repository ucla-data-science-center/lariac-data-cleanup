# LARIAC Data Collections Cleanup

This project manages the consolidation and cleanup of LARIAC (Los Angeles Region Imagery Acquisition Consortium) data access and storage at UCLA.

## Goal
Make **UCLA Dataverse the sole public entry point** for LARIAC data access, with all external links pointing to **one authorized Google Shared Drive**, and eliminate reliance on personal Drives or undocumented access paths.

## Non-goals
*   No ingestion of large assets into Dataverse.
*   No reprocessing or reorganization of data products.
*   No new discovery tools.

## Documentation
*   [CONTEXT.md](./CONTEXT.md): Background and architectural strategy.

## Project Management
Task tracking is handled via [GitHub Project #4](https://github.com/orgs/ucla-data-science-center/projects/4).
